# Covid Portfolio Project
### In this project, we aimed to delve into the Covid-19 death rates by utilizing the data obtained from ourworldindata.org. We started by cleaning and preparing the data in Excel, followed by uploading it to MS SQL Server to perform exploratory analysis. Through the use of various queries, we investigated several aspects of the pandemic such as total cases vs total deaths, the likelihood of dying if you contract Covid-19 in the US, the relationship between population and total cases, countries with the highest infection rate compared to population, the highest death rate per population, Death rate broken down by Continent, total populations vs vaccinations, and creating a view to store data for later visualizations. Our analysis provides valuable insights into the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on different countries and continents, as well as the effectiveness of vaccination efforts in curbing its spread.
